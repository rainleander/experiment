<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>
<p>Where I keep track of the progress of The Farmer Project, Wake Up Beauty It's Time To Beast, Other People's Computers, and Speak Softly - four projects that will probably last the next two years. Or so.</p>

<a id="the-farmer-project" class="anchor" href="#the-farmer-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Farmer Project</h3>
<p>Why Did The Farmer Receive An Award? Because they were out standing in their field.</p>
<p>I will be OUTSTANDING in my fields.</p>
<p>Someone you immediately think of when you need someone to give a keynote about open source or bare metal or cloud computing or developer relations or mental health. Or someone you absolutely swoon about when you find out they’re giving the keynote at a conference you’re attending. It’s not as much that I will be internet famous as I will inspire, encourage, and empower the next generation of non-binary and queer people to join, shape, and revolutionise the tech industry.</p>
<p>To that end, there are three projects that support this main project: Wake Up Beauty, it’s Time to Beast [Health], Other People’s Computers [Technical], and Speak Softly [Leadership].</p>

<p>The Health Project. Cause the other projects won’t happen if I’m physically or mentally Not Here™.</p>
<h3>
<a id="other-peoples-computers" class="anchor" href="#other-peoples-computers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other People’s Computers</h3>
<p>The Technical Project. I will be an expert in the open source, bare metal, cloud computing, and developer relations fields. And I will build something AMAZING. You know how people love ROOK for storage cause it just works? Or Zuul for making massive code integration smooth as silk? Or Packet for giving you bare metal access within minutes? I will help build something that people love because it makes things BETTER.</p>
<h3>
<a id="speak-softly" class="anchor" href="#speak-softly" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speak Softly</h3>
<p>And Carry A Big Stick - the Leadership Project. Not so much the accomplishment of a goal through the direction of assistants, but a focus on helping others and myself do the right thing by developing leadership skills like communication, time management, and project management.</p>
