<p>The Technical Project. I will be an expert in the open source, bare metal, cloud computing, and developer relations fields. And I will build something AMAZING. You know how people love ROOK for storage cause it just works? Or Zuul for making massive code integration smooth as silk? Or Packet for giving you bare metal access within minutes? I will help build something that people love because it makes things BETTER.</p>
