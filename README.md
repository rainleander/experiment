## Figuring Things Out
### S L O W L Y
This is the README.md file. 

Which is also the index page of this particular theme. If I put an actual index.* file, the theme borks out.

Try it; you'll see.

I'm not sure why it's set to post to the index page, but I suppose that makes sense for a site that's built on github. Then again, wouldn't you want the [LICENSE](/experiment/LICENSE) to show up somewhere around here as well? 

But, no, you have to specifically reference it.

Also I've figured out that a change applied within [github.com](https://github.com/rainleander/experiment/edit/master/README.md) doesn't show up instantly over in [github.io](https://rainleander.github.io/experiment/) - sometimes it takes up to three minutes or so. Definite propogation happening.

Let's see what happens next.

## Day Two Of Hackery
### A Little More Progress
The README.md might end up being more of a little journalling thing than a proper README. 

Initially.

In the meantime, here's a lot more bacon lorem ipsum while I figure out the guts of this theme.

Sorry. Not sorry.

Bacon ipsum dolor amet andouille drumstick shank spare ribs. Kevin beef ribs prosciutto pork belly capicola, short ribs shoulder corned beef flank. Burgdoggen kielbasa shankle t-bone swine tenderloin. T-bone pancetta fatback chuck drumstick. Beef venison brisket pancetta jerky.

Pork cow venison ground round. Sirloin andouille tri-tip meatloaf shankle, t-bone fatback bacon kielbasa salami spare ribs pork loin cow. Landjaeger shank alcatra meatloaf, bresaola tri-tip boudin. Capicola bacon prosciutto burgdoggen tail turducken sausage turkey chuck spare ribs.

## This Experiment Might Be Over
### Or Abandoned
Also https://rainleander.github.io/experiment/ returns a 404 now. 

There isn't a GitHub Pages site here.

If you're trying to publish one, read the full documentation to learn how to set up GitHub Pages for your repository, organization, or user account.

So something's shifted in the last TWO YEARS since I was hacking. Definitely a sign that this might be time to move to a new experiment.
