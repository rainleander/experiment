<p>This started out as a frustrating experiment born out of when GroningenRain.nl was hacked two years ago. I wanted somewhere that I could set up as a back up of that site and also to learn a new technology and also to distract my brain from the spiraling depression and anxiety born of an overwhelming helplessness.</p>

<p>And then I completely forgot about it.</p>

<p>And now I'm back.</p>

<p>I don't know what this is anymore, although I do like hacking on it so I'll keep at it for a bit longer.</p>

<p>Let's see how it evolves, eh?</p>
