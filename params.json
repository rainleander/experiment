{"name":"GroningenRain.GitHub.io","tagline":"The Farmer Project","body":"### Welcome to GroningenRain.GitHub.io\r\nWhere I keep track of the progress of The Farmer Project, Wake Up Beauty It's Time To Beast, Other People's Computers, and Speak Softly - four projects that will probably last the next two years. Or more.\r\n\r\n### The Farmer Project\r\nWhy Did The Farmer Receive An Award? Because they were out standing in their field.\r\n\r\nI will be OUTSTANDING in my fields. \r\n\r\nSomeone you immediately think of when you need someone to give a keynote about open source or bare metal or cloud computing or developer relations or mental health. Or someone you absolutely swoon about when you find out they’re giving the keynote at a conference you’re attending. It’s not as much that I will be internet famous as I will inspire, encourage, and empower the next generation of non-binary and queer people to join, shape, and revolutionise the tech industry. \r\n\r\nTo that end, there are three projects that support this main project: Wake Up Beauty, it’s Time to Beast [Health], Other People’s Computers [Hard Skills], and Speak Softly [Soft Skills].\r\n\r\n### Wake Up Beauty It’s Time To Beast\r\nThe Health Project. Cause the other projects won’t happen if I’m physically or mentally Not Here™.\r\n\r\n### Other People’s Computers\r\nThe Technical Project. I will be an expert in the open source, bare metal, cloud computing, and developer relations fields. And I will build something AMAZING. You know how people love ROOK for storage cause it just works? Or Zuul for making massive code integration smooth as silk? Or Packet for giving you bare metal access within minutes? I will help build something that people love because it makes things BETTER.\r\n\r\n### Speak Softly\r\nAnd Carry A Big Stick - the Soft Skills Project. Soft skills are a combination of people skills, social skills, communication skills, character or personality traits, attitudes, career attributes, social intelligence and emotional intelligence quotients, among others, that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals with complementing hard skills. The Collins English Dictionary defines the term \"soft skills\" as \"desirable qualities for certain forms of employment that do not depend on acquired knowledge: they include common sense, the ability to deal with people, and a positive flexible attitude.\"\r\n\r\n“Hard skills include technical or administrative competence”. Soft skills are commonly used to “refer to the “emotional side” of human beings in opposition to the IQ (Intelligent Quotient) component related to hard skills”. Hard and soft skills are usually defined as similar concepts or complements. This fact demonstrates how these two different types of abilities are strictly related.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
